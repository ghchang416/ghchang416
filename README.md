# Chang Gyeonghyun

I am a data engineer who builds the bridge between massive data and intelligent AI services. I believe that the success of AI hinges on the quality and accessibility of its data foundation. With a strong passion for scalable data systems, I design and manage pipelines that transform vast streams of raw, real-time data into the high-quality fuel that powers machine learning models.
